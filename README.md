# hecke-operator

The programs in this repository compute the transformation matrix of a Hecke operator on the vector space of Gamma-equivariant harmonic cocycles with values in Sym^r(V) x det^m or a subspace of it. A detailed explanation of the theory and the code can be found in my [master's thesis](https://typo.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/fileadmin/groups/arithgeo/templates/data/Thesis_Cakir.pdf).
